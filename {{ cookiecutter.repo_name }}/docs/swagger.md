#Swagger UI

This project uses Swagger UI for API documentation. 

Check out the docs at [/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/).

This interface is automatically built thanks to the [django-rest-swagger](https://github.com/marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger)
 Library. 
 
The settings are configured in `{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/swagger_settings.py`
